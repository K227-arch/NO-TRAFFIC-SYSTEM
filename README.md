# No Traffic System

**A Decentralized, AI-Driven Traffic Management System to Eliminate Congestion**

This project is designed to revolutionize traffic management in urban areas by leveraging real-time data, AI, and IoT technologies to prevent traffic congestion. The system optimizes vehicle flow by dynamically adjusting traffic signals, rerouting vehicles, and giving priority to emergency servicesâ€”all without the need for human intervention or a central authority.

## Overview

The **No Traffic System** provides a decentralized solution for managing city traffic by using data from road sensors, GPS-enabled vehicles, and AI algorithms. Each intersection operates autonomously, making decisions based on local data to reduce delays and emissions while providing safe and efficient transportation.

Key benefits include:
- Elimination of traffic jams
- Reduced carbon emissions
- Real-time rerouting to avoid congested roads
- Priority lanes for emergency vehicles

## Features

- **Real-Time Traffic Data Collection:** Uses IoT sensors to gather traffic data, including vehicle count, speed, and road conditions.
- **Decentralized Traffic Management:** Each intersection operates independently, adjusting traffic lights and vehicle flow based on local conditions.
- **Dynamic Rerouting:** Vehicles are rerouted in real-time to avoid congestion using AI-driven predictions.
- **Priority for Emergency Vehicles:** Automatically clears the path for emergency vehicles by optimizing traffic lights and rerouting civilian traffic.
- **Adaptive Traffic Lights:** Traffic lights adjust dynamically based on real-time traffic data to improve intersection flow.
- **Reduced Carbon Footprint:** Fewer idling vehicles result in lower emissions, contributing to a greener city.

## Technologies

- **Internet of Things (IoT):** For collecting traffic data using road sensors and GPS-enabled devices.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Machine learning models predict traffic patterns and provide optimal routes.
- **Edge Computing:** Local decision-making at intersections, reducing latency and central dependencies.
- **GPS:** Used for real-time vehicle tracking and rerouting.
- **Cloud Platform:** Central dashboard for analytics and monitoring.

## System Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **IoT Sensors:** Deployed at key intersections to measure vehicle density, speed, and other traffic parameters.
2. **AI/ML Model:** A machine learning model predicts traffic flow based on historical and real-time data.
3. **Decentralized Traffic Control Units:** Each intersection is equipped with a traffic control unit that processes sensor data locally and adjusts signals and routes in real time.
4. **GPS & Rerouting Module:** Vehicles are rerouted based on AI predictions to optimize overall traffic flow.
5. **Emergency Priority System:** A dedicated module ensures emergency vehicles are always prioritized.
6. **Cloud Dashboard:** Provides analytics, historical traffic patterns, and system health monitoring.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **Python** (v3.8 or later)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployments)
- **IoT hardware** (e.g., traffic sensors, Raspberry Pi for edge computing)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/no-traffic-system.git
    cd no-traffic-system
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. Run the frontend app:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the backend server and ensure IoT sensors are correctly configured.
2. Access the frontend dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` to monitor real-time traffic data.
3. You can simulate traffic flow or use actual sensor data to test the system's response to congestion, emergency vehicle routing, and rerouting features.

### Simulated Traffic Mode

To test the system with simulated traffic, use the provided scripts in the `/simulation` folder:
```bash
python simulate_traffic.py
